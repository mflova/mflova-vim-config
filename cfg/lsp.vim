" COMPILATION DATABASE: It is necessary to tell the CPP based linters how to
" compile the program. It can be done by adding
" set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS) in the CMakeLists or with the flag
" -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON in the cmake command. This will generate
"  a compilationcommands.json that needs to be read by setting the env
"  variable CPP_BUILD_DIR.
"
" STUBSPATH: Where the stubs are read. Set it as env variable. It is
" recommended to be the same one as MYPYPATH, so that both Pyright and MYPY
" both read the stubs from the same folder. Stubs are generated by a command
" in vim that uses stubgen (mypy) and whose output is MYPYPATH. Therefore, by
" setting STUBSPATH to MYPYPATH will make both of them to work.
