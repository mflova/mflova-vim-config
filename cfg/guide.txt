" Pending:
"     Edit this plugin https://github.com/kkoomen/vim-doge to be used
"     | Find and replace | easy tool/Plugin
"     Sync vimrc with github. Follow: https://github.com/igemnace/vim-config
"        Ideas: Repo git that installs vim and copies the files to vimrc. It will also copy a script (update_vim_git) that will contain the root of the repo so that each time is executed, the repo is updated.
